1. EMJMCMC 1.2.tar.gz (GNU zipped tar) file includes the most recent version of EMJMCMC package.

2. To install the package the user would need to run install.packages("https://github.com/aliaksah/EMJMCMC2016/files/270429/EMJMCMC_1.2.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type="source"). Notice that some dependencies may be required (see for derails http://aliaksah.github.io/EMJMCMC2016/).

3. /R/the_mode_jumping_package2.r containes R OOP code for MJMCMC algorithm used in EMJMCMC package.

4. /paper/appedix.pdf contains proofs of the ergodicity of MJMCMC procedure and pseudo codes for MJMCMC and local combinatorial optimizers.

5. /examples/BAS/ archive contains the original BAS package that is addressed in the experiments along with EMJMCMC.

6. /examples/Simulated Data (Example 1)/ contains data (simcen-x.txt, simcen-y.txt) and code (mode_jumping_package_class_simulated_bas_data_1906.r, mode_jumping_package_class_simulated_bas_data_3211.r) for the first experiment. Notice that /examples/Simulated Data/BAS includes BAS based replications for the same experiment.

7. /examples/US Data/ contains cetured U.S. Crime data (simcen-x1.txt, simcen-y1.txt) and code (mode_jumping_package_class_crime_bas_data_1909.r, mode_jumping_package_class_crime_bas_data_3237.r) for the second experiment. Notice that /examples/US Data/BAS includes BAS based replications for the same experiment.

8. /examples/Simulated Logistic Data With Multiple Modes (Example 3)/ contains simulated data (sim3-X.txt, sim3-Y.txt) and code (mode_jumping_package_class_example3_5000.r, mode_jumping_package_class_example3_10000.r) for the third experiment. Notice that /examples/Simulated Logistic Data With Multiple Modes (Example 3)/BAS includes BAS based replications for the same experiment.

9. /examples/Epigenetic Data/ contains Arabadopsis genetic and epigenetic data (epigen.txt) and code (epigenetic data poisson regression with a random effect 350.r, epigenetic data poisson regression with a random effect 500.r) for the fourth experiment. precalculated.csv contains the precalculated models for the poisson regression with an AR(1) random effect for the addressed part of genome.

10. /examples/Protein Activity Data/ contains the protein activity data (proteincen.txt) and code (mode_jumping_package_class_example3_5000.r, mode_jumping_package_class_example3_10000.r) for the third experiment. Notice that /examples/Protein Activity Data/BAS includes BAS based replications for the same experiment.
