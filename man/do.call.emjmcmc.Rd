\arguments{
\item{vect}{a vector of parameters of runemjmcmc as well as several
additional fields that must come after runemjmcmc parameters such as:
\describe{
 \item{vect$simlen}{the number of parameters of runemjmcmc in vect}
 \item{vect$cpu}{the CPU id for to set the unique seed}
 \item{vect$NM}{the number of unique best models from runemjmcmc to
   base the output report upon}
}}
}
\value{
a list of
\describe{
 \item{post.populi}{the total mass (sum of the marginal likelihoods times
   the priors of the visited models) from the addressed run of runemjmcmc}
 \item{p.post}{posterior probabilities of the covariates approximated by the
   addressed run of runemjmcmc}
 \item{cterm}{the best value of marginal likelihood times the prior from
   the addressed run of runemjmcmc}
 \item{fparam}{the final set of covariates returned by the addressed
   run of runemjmcmc}
