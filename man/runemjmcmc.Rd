\description{
The algorithm is an extended Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
(or its Genetically modified version) mixing single site changes with
occationally large jumps. The models are described through the gamma vector,
a binary vector indicating which variables that are included in the model.
}
\details{
See Hubin & Storvik (2016),Hubin, Storvik & Frommlet (2017),
Hubin & Storvik (2017) details. The local optimization is performed through
stepwise search within a neighborhood in the current gamma vector, allowing
one component to be changed at a time.
